    <h2>
      The ancient history  of the walls
    </h2>
    <p>
      The 144th king of Eldia took the remaining survivors to Paradise Island, and with his <strong>Founding Titan </strong>he summoned hundres of Colossial Titans and positoned them into a wall like shape and made them harden (their bodies),thus creating the three walls of paradis, that protect (sometimes) and serves the people .The walls are about 50 meters high and acts as an defense barrier. The wall stood tall for over 100 years, and many trials and tribulations, it still stands tall.
